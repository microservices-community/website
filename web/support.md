## Support for Open Source Projects and Job Advertisement

The Microservices Community supports its members and its affiliated open-source projects (and to a limited extent, also prospecting ones&mdash;see the rules below) with the following retweet policies for job announcements and news from open-source projects.

### Job Advertisement retweeting policy

Members of the Microservices Community that post a job announcement on Twitter can be retweeted from the official Community channel following the process below.
Also non-members of the Community can access this service, for the limited amount of 5 unique retweets.
After that, the poster can afford more retweets by [becoming a member](/join) of the Community.

Instruction for retweeting a job announcement:
- mention the Twitter handle [**@c_microservices**](https://twitter.com/c_microservices) in the initial job announcement; 
- briefly indicate the role of Microservices in the job position (design, development, education, ...); 
- the announcement must be aligned with the Community [statutes](/statutes) and [code of conduct](/coc).

### Open Source projects retweeting policy

Affiliated open-source projects of the Microservices Community that post on Twitter can be retweeted from the official Community channel following the process below.
Also non-affiliated projects can access this service, for the limited amount of 5 unique retweets.
After that, the poster can afford more retweets by [becoming an affiliated open-source project](/join) of the Community.

Instruction for retweeting a post from open-source project:
- mention the Twitter handle [**@c_microservices**](https://twitter.com/c_microservices) in the initial post; 
- briefly indicate the role of Microservices in the news about the project (e.g., design choices, how it helps microservice development, ...); 
- the content of the post must be aligned with the Community [statutes](/statutes) and [code of conduct](/coc).

<div class="panel-heading"><strong>Retweet handling and approval process</strong></div>
<div class="panel-body">
Both of policies are automatically handled by the Community Communication Group, which decides on how to proceed with the retweet. 
In case the post does not fulfil the mandatory requirements above, the Group will not directly notify the rejection to the poster. If after 48h from the initial tweet you do not see the message retweeted, you can contact the communication group <a href="communication@microservices.community">communication@microservices.community</a> for information.
