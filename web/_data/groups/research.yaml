mission:
  short: |
    The Research Community Group aims at structuring a research community on microservices, which comprises both researchers and practitioners
    daily working with microservices.
  long: |
    The goal of the Research Community Group is to organize and promote a fruitful exchange of information among researchers and practitioners
    working with microservices, as well as to promote research directions on microservices, their engineering, and exploitation. Each task
    force of the community group is focused on a specific microservices-related research topic, and all task forces interoperate to achieve common
    research results.

      content: |
        <p>Have you recently <b>published an interesting result related on microservices</b>? Would you like to <b>open a discussion on blue-sky microservices-related
        research</b>? These are just two of the possible reasons for holding a webinar in the <b>MC Research Group monthly webinars</b>.</p>
        <p>The goal of MC Research Webinars is to <b>disseminate and cross-fertilize results and best practices</b> among researchers and practitioners working with
        microservices. Webinars are intended to include 30-45 minutes of presentation, plus a session of Q&A. Based on speakersâ€™ wishes, presentation and Q&A can be recorded
        and later posted on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvq51rztJ6LETiCa30PNlzQ">MC's YouTube channel</a>, e.g., to give more possibilities to the presented
        research and discussion to get visible to people interested in microservices.</p>
        <p>In case you would like to share ideas, best practices, or recent results on any topic related microservices, <b>please feel free to contact Jacopo Soldani
        (MC Research Group Coordinator)</b> using <a href="

      <h4 style="margin-top: 20px">Microservices & AI</h4>
      <i>Coordinator</i>&#58; Ivan Lanese

      <i>Description</i>&#58; Currently, microservices are used in a number of
      application areas. It is clear that AI and machine learning are at this
      stage a particularly relevant application area, pushed both by private
      companies and public stakeholders. While most of the microservice features
      and techniques are independent of the application area, this is not always
      the case, and specific needs, approaches and solutions may be more relevant
      in one area than in others. The task force on "Microservices & AI" aims at
      discussing and understanding the interplay between microservices on one side
      and AI and machine learning on the other side. Activities include, but are
      not limited to&#58;
      <ul>
          <li>facilitating discussion and joint work among people interested in
              the topic</li>
          <li>organization of seminars on the topic</li>
          <li>organization of workshops or tracks on the topic, inside
              microservice or AI conferences</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 20px">Microservices Management</h4>
      <i>Coordinator</i>&#58; Silvia Lizeth Tapia Tarifa

      <i>Description</i>&#58; Microservices are built to run scalable applications
      and are easy to adapt to distributed hardware. Containers encapsulate
      execution environments for Microservices, allowing services to be managed,
      e.g., with respect to service performance, resource utilisation, etc.
      Technology for the systematic management of containerised applications
      across multiple hosts is an interesting area to study challenges related to
      orchestration, deployment, scalability, resource analysis, failure recovery,
      etc. This research task force can focus on facilitate the collaboration and
      dissemination of results, and facilitate discussions to identify research
      interest and challenges related to technology for the systematic management
      of microservices.
