                      <a href=\"https://www.imolainformatica.it/home-en/\">Imola Informatica</a>, you will learn about Ballerina, a cloud-native
                      programming language. Developers spend more time integrating cloud-native technologies to their programming language,
                      compared to the core business logic. Ballerina offers language integrated features, such as network awareness through a
                      built-in services concept, communication resilience, observability, and deployment technology awareness, such as Kubernetes.
                      It's an open source project, Apache 2 licensed.
