title: The Microservices Community
---

We are an international community interested in the software paradigm of [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices). Our overarching aims are the sharing of knowledge and the fostering of collaborations about microservices. We have a broad composition, including people from research institutions, private companies, universities, and public organisations (like municipalities). We strongly believe in the importance of discussing open issues and solutions from different points of view, to create foundations for both innovation and basic research.

The microservices community was born during the first edition of the [International Conference on Microservices](http://conf-micro.services).

[Fabrizio Montesi](https://www.fabriziomontesi.com/) is the coordinator of the Microservices Community until the finalisation of the Microservices Community Steering Committee. The formation of the steering committee will be discussed at the upcoming [Microservices Conference 2019](https://conf-micro.services). 

Come and join us!

# Activities

The main activities of the Microservices Community currently include, but are not limited to, the following.

- Organise the International Conference on Microservices once a year ([http://conf-micro.services](http://conf-micro.services)), which acts also as a recurring opportunity for the physical gathering of the community.

- Support the organisation of focused events on microservices. Examples include: technical workshops on industrial technologies, national meetings (like the [Italian Meeting on Microservices](http://www.italianasoftware.com/mom2016_eng.html)), and academic forums.

- Provide funding opportunities for travelling and the organisation of events in general.

- Publish open access material on microservices, either through the website as informal publications (white papers), or through more formal channels (like edited books with chapters from multiple authors, or journals).

- Provide resources for the digital platform of the community, including this website.
