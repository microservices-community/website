We are an international community interested in the software paradigm of [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices). Our overarching aims are the sharing of knowledge and the fostering of collaborations about microservices. We have a broad composition, including people from research institutions, private companies, universities, and public organisations (like municipalities). We strongly believe in the importance of discussing open issues and solutions from different points of view, to create foundations for both innovation and basic research.

The microservices community was born during the first edition of the [International Conference on Microservices](http://conf-micro.services).
