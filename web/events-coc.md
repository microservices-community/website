## Code of Conduct - Events
</div>

Any event organised or endorsed by the Microservices Community must be in line with the values and culture of equality, openness, and respect of the Microservices Community.
Specifically, events organised or endorsed by the Microservices Community are required to adopt the following code of conduct or implement equivalent guarantees.

<div class="section-title" markdown="1">
### Introduction
</div>

We are dedicated to providing a harassment­ free experience for everyone, and we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We ask you to be considerate of others
and behave professionally and respectfully to all other participants. This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities,
in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of
any community member. Exhibitors, speakers, sponsors, staff and all other attendees at events organised by or in collaboration with the Microservices Community are subject to these Community
Guidelines and Code of Conduct.

Diversity and inclusion make the Microservices Community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly Microservices Community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other protected categories under applicable law.
